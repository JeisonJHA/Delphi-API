## UPDATE!!

## Formatter

File formats that use the theme "Pascal" or "Delphi".
It uses the [jedi formatter](http://jedicodeformat.sourceforge.net/), but you can change to use the one of your preference.
Configurations:
* "path_formatter": "C:\MyFormatter.exe"
* "auto_format": true
* "encode": "'Western (Windows 1252)'"
* "validate_encode": false

## Next steps
    ## Method Comment
    
    This insert the comment of the method that the cursor is on.
  
    Ex:
    /// <summary>
    ///  Comment of the method
    /// </summary>
    /// <param name="ParamName">
    /// </param>
    /// <returns>
    ///  Return type
    /// </returns>
    /// <remarks>
    ///  Author
    /// </remarks>
  
    ## Add TAG
    
    This insert the user TAG in the line of the cursor
    
    ## Declare Method
    
    This works like the "Ctrl+Shift+C" of the Delphi, the diference is that this works only
    for the method that is in scope.
    
    ## Extract Method
    
    You select the snippet you want to extract and the plugin will identify which parameters
     are required for the new method and includes in the new method. 
    The new method will be inserted with the name "ExtractedMethod" you just need to write the
     name you want to change the declaration will use and implementation of the method.
    
    ## Exchange method return
    
    Changes the return of the method, for procedure if you do not inform a return type or function if you do.
    
    ## Syncronize method declaration
    
    Syncronize the parameters of the method of implementation and interface with the method that is in scope.
