## UPDATE!!


## Declare Method
    
    This works like the "Ctrl+Shift+C" of the Delphi, the diference is that this works only
    for the method that is in scope.

## Config    
  
    where to create the method
    "visibility": "protected",
    if the block configured don't exists it will create it.
    the block will be created at the end of the class.
    "create_visibility_block": true

## Know issues:
    If the command is triggered it will create a new statement, does not validate if it already exists.


## Next steps
    
    ## Extract Method
    
    You select the snippet you want to extract and the plugin will identify which parameters
     are required for the new method and includes in the new method. 
    The new method will be inserted with the name "ExtractedMethod" you just need to write the
     name you want to change the declaration will use and implementation of the method.
    
    ## Exchange method return
    
    Changes the return of the method, for procedure if you do not inform a return type or function if you do.
    
    ## Syncronize method declaration
    
    Syncronize the parameters of the method of implementation and interface with the method that is in scope.
