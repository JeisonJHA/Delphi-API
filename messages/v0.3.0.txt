## Next steps
    
    ## Declare Method
    
    This works like the "Ctrl+Shift+C" of the Delphi, the diference is that this works only
    for the method that is in scope.
    
    ## Extract Method
    
    You select the snippet you want to extract and the plugin will identify which parameters
     are required for the new method and includes in the new method. 
    The new method will be inserted with the name "ExtractedMethod" you just need to write the
     name you want to change the declaration will use and implementation of the method.
    
    ## Exchange method return
    
    Changes the return of the method, for procedure if you do not inform a return type or function if you do.
    
    ## Syncronize method declaration
    
    Syncronize the parameters of the method of implementation and interface with the method that is in scope.
